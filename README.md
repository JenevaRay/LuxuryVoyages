## Description
We wrote this app to help people keep track of things they would like to do while on vacation.

# Technologies New to Us, which were used
* frontend: flatpickr (date picker) & leaflet (mapping system)
* backend: wiki-voyages-listings (90MB CSV -> 122MB SQL) - see below for access


## Features
* Full user sessions support (including timeouts)
* Custom Leaflet.js UI additions (colored markers, create-an-itinerary from wiki entry, create-an-itinerary from map location)
& the ability to delete created itinerary markers.
* Bootstrap modals for itinerary creation.
* full HTTPS compatibility, including with session cookies.

## To Do List
Polish the HTML portions of the site.
Business partnerships with destinations.

## Commentary
A lot of work was done rapidly, with the loss of a team member, we thought it would have to be delayed or features cut, but considering, I think we did pretty well delivering a full-featured product with fewer people than we needed!
